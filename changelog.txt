Version 0.2:

Main:
- Upon defeating the Wall of Flesh:
	Players are inflicted with the "Before the Storm" buff, which greatly reduces spawnrates for 10 minutes
	Mechanical Cores spawn throughout the world
		After the "Before the Storm" buff is cleared, they will inflict "The Storm" debuff onto all distant* players
	
- Plant enemies like Man Eaters and Snatchers regenerate health over time
- Jellyfish inflict Acid Venom and Electrified
- Armored Skeletons take much less damage the more health they have
- Skeleton Archers fire much faster
- Herplings and Derplings move much faster
- Hallow enemies spawn Enchanted Swords on death
- Unicorns fire ethereal lances at the player
- Pixies fire prismatic bolts at the player
- Chaos Elementals teleport a bit more often
- Tortoises are much faster
- Mimics and Biome Mimics can forcibly drop your held item on the ground
- Biome Mimics are faster, shoot projectiles when closed and periodically spawn living weapons depending on mimic type
- Paladins heal nearby enemies


Bosses:
- The Destroyer:
	Now has 4 phases:
		- Slows down, moves towards the player and fires a barrage of lasers from its mouth
		- Slows down further, summoning Bomb Slimes from its body
		- Chases the player aggressively
		- Standard Behaviour
	Enters desparation phase when below 10% hp, constantly firing a barrage of lasers
- The Twins:
	Retinazer fires lasers faster in both phases, dashes faster in first phase
	Spazmatism dashes much faster in phase 2, and fires barrages of cursed flames alongside its flamethrower
	A Forgotten Sibling spawns alongside them and reduces their damage taken by 50% until it is destroyed
- Skeletron Prime:
	Vice and Saw despawn minions on hit and inflict Withered Armor, Cursed, Bleeding and Weak
	Laser now periodically hovers above the player, firing lasers downwards
	Cannon can fire volleys of bombs upwards
	When all arms are dead, Prime becomes more aggressive, moving much faster and firing skulls and lasers


Items:
	- Undead Amulet (Dropped by Skeletron [100%] and Angry Bones [1%])
		While equipped, prevents curse level from increasing when dying


Buffs/Debuffs:
	- "Before the Storm" decreases spawn rates. 
		Cannot be re-obtained once removed. Spend those 10 minutes wisely
	- "The Storm" increases spawn rates and max spawns, and also allows spirits to spawn.
		Spirits can move through tiles and can spawn anywhere, aggressively hunting the player down until they destroy all Mechanical Cores

Other:
- Increased Life Essence drop rate and amount from undead enemies
- Life Essence can be crafted from Boss Trophies
- When Recipe Randomizer is enabled, only certain items can be ingredients, which should hopefully fix any possible conflicts

	Bosses which increase the buff limit by 1 on defeat are: Eye of Cthulhu, Skeletron, Deerclops
	Bosses which increase the buff limit by 2 on defeat are: Queen Bee, Queen Slime, Pumpking, Ice Queen
