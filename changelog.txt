Buffs/Debuffs:
	- "Before the Storm" decreases spawn rates. 
		Cannot be re-obtained once removed. Spend those 10 minutes wisely
	- "The Storm" increases spawn rates and max spawns, and also allows spirits to spawn.
		Spirits can move through tiles and can spawn anywhere, aggressively hunting the player down until they destroy all Mechanical Cores

Other:
- Increased Life Essence drop rate and amount from undead enemies
- Life Essence can be crafted from Boss Trophies
- When Recipe Randomizer is enabled, only certain items can be ingredients, which should hopefully fix any possible conflicts
- Blacklisted certain items from the recipe randomizer, such as progression-relevant pickaxes

	Bosses which increase the buff limit by 1 on defeat are: Eye of Cthulhu, Skeletron, Deerclops

- Hot projectiles can no longer destroy furniture because of weird interactions
